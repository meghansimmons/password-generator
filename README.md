# Password Generator

A password generator was created to provide the user with a randomly selected password when a few conditions are met. The password length must be between 8 and 128 characters.  At least one character type must be chosen.  The four character types include special characters, numeric characters and both upper and lowercase letters. After all conditions are met, the password generator displays a randomly generated password. The user can then copy the password to be used as needed. The password generator was created with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
